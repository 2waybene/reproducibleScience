While working as bioinformatician, I realize that often time we need to use other people's data to get supportive evidence for my own research. I have had a few very successful stories and I want to document what I have done for others.

Here are a rough ist of study I am working on, I will have both the code and record a video for others to follow.

1. single call RNAseq study (GSE242666)
2. single cell ATACseq study(
3. single cell trajectory analysis

GSE242666
